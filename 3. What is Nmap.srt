00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,390
Let's start by giving you a quick introduction as to why and map is and map short for network mapper

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:13,830
is a free and open source command line tool for Network Discovery and security assessment is used by

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,400
ethical hackers penetration testers systems administrators black hackers and anyone in fact who wants

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,540
to understand more about the devices on a given network is also often called a network scanner or a

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,620
port scanner because it scans for open ports on devices.

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:38,390
But it has much more functionality than just a simple port on network scanner and port scanning.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,950
If you're not familiar with what that means what that term is.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,350
Well this will tell the user of the scanner what ports are open on the scan devices and therefore what

9
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:57,120
services are running such as as you can see here we've got port 22 open so we know on this device which

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,360
happens to be 1 9 2 don't want to say I don't want one that is potentially S-sh and it's giving us some

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,890
version information here so we can say that this is S-sh or it could be poor 80 and it could be hasty

12
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,750
TPA web server or 53 which is a DNS server.

13
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,910
So that is what ports does does doors and map.

14
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:25,710
It determines whether the host is up and it determines what the host is running on it and it can do

15
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:34,230
that across multiple different domain names and IP addresses and map users rural IP packets specially

16
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,860
crafted in order to determine this.

17
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:43,290
So it tells you as I've said what houses are available on a given network what services as we can see

18
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,160
here the services like the application name and the version the House that are available in this instance

19
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,090
we can see one or the 1:06 I don't want as I've said and potentially what operating system we can see

20
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,430
here Linux we can see here the Linux kernel and depending on the scan what type of packet filtering

21
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:07,800
firewalls are in use and many of the characteristics can be deemed using unmap and that also is a powerful

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,480
scripting capability.

23
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:16,080
It allows users to write and share scripts using the alleyway louer programming language to automate

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,430
a wide variety of networking tasks including things like network discovery more sophisticated version

25
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,180
detection and vulnerability detection.

26
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,950
It can be used scripting can be used for vulnerability exploitation and even brute forcing.

27
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:41,190
Emma was designed to rapidly scan large networks but works fine against single host to chat rooms on

28
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,760
all major operating systems and official Minories are avail for Linux Windows and Mac OS X to name a

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,480
few.

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,920
In addition to the classic command line and map executable we can see the output here and map Swee also

31
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,870
includes a GUI called Zend map which you can see here for a graphical interface to unmap all of which

32
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,610
were going to go through on this course.

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,260
So that was your quick introduction to encapsulate.

34
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,020
Carry on.
