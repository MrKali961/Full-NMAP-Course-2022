00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,550
Greetings and welcome to my end of course.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,350
Let me give you a quick introduction as to who I am.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,870
If you don't know already my name is Nathan house and I'm the CEO and founder of the cyber security

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:18,010
company station X. And I'll be on Struktur throughout this comprehensive and Emap course over 24 years

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,990
experience in cybersecurity and I've advised many of the largest companies in the world.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,830
Sure that's good.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,410
A multi-million and even multi-billion pound projects I provide security guidance to companies such

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:37,900
as Vodafone BP visa the London 2012 Olympics and a number of banks and financial institutions plus many

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,130
other companies.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:45,100
I was a security lead on a number of the UK mobile banking apps so if you live in the UK you may well

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,620
have an app on your phone that I have helped secure.

12
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:57,820
I have many security qualifications including susp cism CSA SC among others over the years.

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,910
I spoke on a number of conferences develop free security tools and discovered serious security vulnerabilities

14
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,280
in leading applications as a security educator.

15
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:15,660
I have sold over 50000 courses which were all highly reviewed and excellently rated of a popular cybersecurity

16
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:21,500
blog and I currently have over 60000 active Twitter followers who listen to my advice.

17
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,590
So in theory I should know what I'm talking about when it comes to network security.

18
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,850
Ethical hacking cyber security alerts have just been getting away with it all these years.

19
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:38,290
It's never been more important than it is today to maintain good security and to lie unmap helps in

20
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:44,230
that task and extremely passionate about helping you learn and achieve your goals.

21
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,690
And I'm very excited to be here to teach you.

22
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,960

23
